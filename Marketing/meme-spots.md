# Meme-Based Marketing Spots

10 video/image spot concepts using meme formats. Each designed for short-form social (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Reddit).

## 1. Distracted Boyfriend: The SSH Betrayal

**Meme:** distractedBoyfriend.png

- **Boyfriend (you):** Dev trying to check on their Claude Code session
- **Girlfriend (angry):** SSH tunnel that corporate firewall killed
- **Other woman:** MidTerm running on port 2000

**Caption:** "When HTTP just works and SSH doesn't"

**Hook:** Relatable pain of SSH being blocked at coffee shops, hotels, corporate networks.

## 2. Two Buttons: The Cloud Terminal Dilemma

**Meme:** 2 buttons meme.png

- **Button 1:** "Pay $50/month for cloud terminal"
- **Button 2:** "Put my API keys on someone else's server"
- **Sweating guy:** Every dev running AI coding agents
- **Punchline text below:** "MidTerm: Run locally, access anywhere"

**Hook:** Cloud terminals force this choice. MidTerm doesn't.

## 3. Batman Slap: The SSH Evangelist

**Meme:** batmanSlap.png

- **Robin says:** "Just SSH into your machi—"
- **Batman slaps:** "FIREWALL"
- **Alt version Robin:** "Just use a cloud termi—"
- **Alt version Batman:** "MY API KEYS"

**Hook:** The two most common "solutions" both have dealbreakers.

## 4. Hackerman: One-Click Update

**Meme:** hackerman.png

- **Scene:** Hackerman at keyboard, glowing monitors
- **Caption:** "Me clicking 'Update & Restart' in the browser"
- **Subtext:** "15MB binary go brrrr"
- **Context:** Contrast between how badass it feels vs how simple it is

**Hook:** Self-update without touching the command line = elite hacker energy.

## 5. Most Interesting Man: The Terminal Connoisseur

**Meme:** mostinteresting man in the world.png

- **Setup:** "I don't always run AI coding agents..."
- **Punchline:** "...but when I do, I watch them from my phone"
- **Alt version:** "I don't always leave my desk mid-refactor..."
- **Alt punchline:** "...but when I do, Claude Code keeps running"

**Hook:** Sophisticated flex about mobile terminal access.

---

## 6. Drake Format: Installation Methods

**Meme:** (Drake dislike/like - would need to generate)

- **Drake rejecting:** npm install → docker pull → configure nginx → set up SSL
- **Drake approving:** `curl ... | bash` → done
- **Context:** One-liner install vs. the competition's setup docs
- **Subtext:** "15MB. No dependencies. No runtime."

**Hook:** Installation simplicity is a feature.

---

## 7. Expanding Brain: Terminal Access Evolution

**Meme:** (Expanding brain - would need to generate)

- **Small brain:** Sitting at desk watching terminal
- **Normal brain:** SSH tunnel (blocks at hotels)
- **Glowing brain:** Cloud terminal ($50/month, their servers)
- **Galaxy brain:** MidTerm (your machine, any browser)

**Hook:** Each "solution" has tradeoffs until MidTerm.

## 8. This Is Fine: Long-Running Tasks

**Meme:** (Dog in fire room - would need to generate)

- **Frame 1:** Dev at desk, terminal running build, clock shows 5pm
- **Frame 2:** "I can't leave until this finishes"
- **Frame 3 (with MM):** Same dev on phone at restaurant, terminal still visible
- **Caption:** "This is fine" → "This is actually fine"

**Hook:** Being chained to your desk vs. freedom.

---

## 9. Gru Plan: The Self-Hosted Journey

**Meme:** (Gru presentation - would need to generate)

- **Panel 1:** "Set up self-hosted terminal access"
- **Panel 2:** "Use simple HTTP instead of SSH"
- **Panel 3:** "15MB single binary, works everywhere"
- **Panel 4 (surprised):** "Wait, it actually just works?"

**Hook:** Subverting expectations—self-hosted usually means pain.

---

## 10. Panik/Kalm: The Meeting Interrupt

**Meme:** (Panik/Kalm/Panik - would need to generate)

- **Panik:** Claude Code is doing a huge refactor
- **Kalm:** It'll keep running, I'll check from my phone
- **Kalm (stays kalm):** Opens browser, types localhost:2000, enters password
- **Context:** What was a crisis is now a non-event

**Hook:** The emotional journey from anxiety to "oh right, I have MidTerm."
